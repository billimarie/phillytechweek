# NOTES

## INTRO

I'm on a mission to normalize activism through technology.

As the maintainer of an open-source, community oversight project dedicated to holding prosecutors accountable, my work as a developer and organizer is directly informed by my experiences advocating for prisoners' rights, as well as abolitionist ideology.

This project, the U.S. Prosecutor Database, doesn't operate like a typical open-source project. We're a small, but dedicated group that works independently during the week to populate our ambitious project.

Every Sunday, we meet remotely and in-person--I make crepes--for working sessions we call Datathons. We work collectively as activists to brainstorm solutions and gather prosecutor data. I've organized and structured these sessions by merging an open-source philosophy with localized social justice tracks--all in service of abolition.

This talk is about how I, as a developer, gained meaning and inspiration by combining these two worlds:

Open-Source. Social Justice.

For the purposes of our conversation, the phrase "Open-Source" is built of three basic tenets: Peer Production, Open and Mass Collaboration, and Transparency. The phrase "Social Justice" refers to any work that is done in service of ending societal oppression within a narrow scope--prisoners' rights, for instance. Or Environmentalism. Civil Rights. LGBTQ rights.

As a developer who has operated in tech spaces, social justice spaces, and a fusion of those two worlds, I want you to come away from this talk with one truth: Developer and Tech spaces can benefit from social justice and grassroots activist thinking.

The activist framework is comprised of three components: Mindfulness, Playfulness, and Honoring Contributions.

These three points are a means of survival for activists, who often operate in highly-charged spaces, invest in high-risk stakes, and often suffer from extreme instances of burn-out.

As individuals operating in tech and developer spaces, you are the force that can bring positive change to your organization. You are the spark that can enhance the quality of your relations, your products, your audience. You are the light that can activate an untold number of other lights. 

I'll touch on this more at the end of the talk, but for now, let's jump to the first point:

## MINDFULNESS

Understanding and minding the current environment's normalized hierarchy and power.

Within tech and developer spaces, especially those deeply driven by capitalistic survival, we can easily become lethargic as compassion humans, and simply give in to the status quo.

This first step, mindfulness, simply means noticing dynamics. Who's talking? Who's not talking? Why aren't they talking? Where is everyone's energy directed to?

Why do we need to notice these things? Because we easily fall into the habit of going along with environmental flow. You and I both know how easy it is to allow the spaces we're part of to operate organically, with or without us--and unless you're experiencing the chemical highs of being in love, this state is often not the most compatible for all of the participants.

Just like a codebase, our interactions within a given environment are our contributions. We are constantly committing to these spaces--whether we're conscious of that fact, or not.

The system must be maintained. When we're in a meeting--the system must be maintained. When we're talking to our peers one-on-one--the system must be maintained. Social relations and environments are a complex dynamo of human entanglement...one could call it a codebase. But one might be reaching. As developers, when we forget to be mindful of the space we're operating in, we fail to consider that the system--this system of people just being people--this system must be maintained. And whether we like it or not, we are a core part of that.

Remind yourself that you are actively contributing in and to a social system. You are accountable for what you commit.

Once you check in with yourself about minding the space you're given, the next step is playfulness.

## PLAYFULNESS

How are you choosing to engage with a space? With other participants?

Bringing a sense of playfulness and compassion to how you contribute to a room, a space, another human is vital.

A good way to dip your toes into this is to simply ask: "What do you think?" "I'm curious what everyone else thinks."

The goal is to create a tiny breath of fresh air so that a new type of flow can emerge.

That's the goal. Recognizing that within developer, tech, business spaces, it's very easy to get caught up in a system that regulates itself, and it's hard to apply changes. One way to challenge that is to playfully engage with it. Whether you're playfully engaging in a big or a small way--and hey, we all know little tiny bug fixes save a lot of lives down the line--you are capable and responsible for challenging the system you've been given by playfully creating breathing room for authentic, positive experiences to emerge.

## "I" TO "WE"

Operating in developer, tech, business spaces--there's this pull toward a very egotistical way of thinking--"I did this. I did that." There's something really isolating about it. There's a beauty to life that can be touched when you're in the throws of bringing people with you, when you're honoring those connections by calling attention to how you did not operate in a vacuum (because love, none of us do).

So bring people with you. If you can't do it physically, then state it plainly.

"I" is a "We". "I" is an eye that reflects each other--and there's brilliance and beauty in that. You're not a representative. You're part of the endless, eternal thread.

Again, as developers, it's important to recall that the self is a series of commits by a variety of contributors. Call attention to that. 

## CONCLUSION

Space is an intimate, living, breathing system you contribute to merely by being. You are not only capable of improving the passive feedback loops you've been given--you also have a duty to do so. A responsibility to disrupt more than capitalistic frameworks. Enhance human ones, too. 

The hope is that as developers, as people existing daily in tech and business spaces, this mode not only creates positive change in your working life--but that it trickles down into the products, the devices, the audience that digest the stuff you contribute to. 

I'm excited to see how you embed these three components in your everyday spaces. Remember: this is not a next step. It's a moonshot.

Thank you.
